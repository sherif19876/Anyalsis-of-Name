# Target Group Voter Filter

This script loads a large voter file, a list of target names (first and last), and an optional precinct-to-district mapping. It identifies voters whose first or last name matches any name in the target lists (flexible matching: first name can match a target first or last name, and same for last name). The resulting filtered data (with selected columns) is saved as a CSV.

## Key features

- Cleans precinct numbers (removes trailing `.1`).
- Uses set operations for fast name lookup.
- Flexible matching (cross-checks first/last names against both name lists).
- Merges with district mapping if available (handles missing columns gracefully).
- Exports only the columns you specify.

## Use case

Ideal for extracting specific demographic or community groups from a voter roll using a curated list of names. For example, identifying voters belonging to a particular ethnic, religious, or cultural group based on name lists.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- `pandas`

## Input files (adjust paths in the script)

- `voter_data.csv` – Must contain `Name First`, `Name Last`, `Precinct`, and any other columns you wish to export.
- `target_names.csv` – Must contain columns `First Name` and `Last Name`.
- `precincts_city_council_districts.csv` (optional) – Used to add district information.

## Output

- `target_group_voters_filtered.csv` – All rows from the voter file that match the target name lists, with only the selected columns.
